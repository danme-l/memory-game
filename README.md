# Rick and Morty Card Guessing game
Created for the React Section of the Odin Project.

Work in progress - it's mostly finished, but I can't get the user card input to work at the moment, and then there are lots of styling fixes to implement.

Used in this app:
* [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)
* The Rick and Morty Spinning Header icons I for from [icons8](https://icons8.com/)

### Getting Started with Create React App
